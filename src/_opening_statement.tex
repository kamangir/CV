In the late nineties, I was finishing my undergraduate studies in electrical engineering, when I received word that the biomechanics laboratory had acquired a frame-grabber and were looking for someone to help them code up the device into a gait analysis system, i.e. two camcorders captured a person on the catwalk and our software produced a csv file that contained two sets of x-y trajectories for each retroreflective spherical marker that we had attached on the person's joints. Later on, we added pedobarography (image-based foot pressure analysis) to the system and the team performed a study on patients with diabetes.

Image processing was applied mathematics on images, and I started a master's program on color image processing at the mathematics science department in 2003. This was an introduction to higher mathematical concepts such as linear spaces and principal component analysis (PCA). This latter one introduced me to watermarking, color transfer (to colored and grayscale images), and semantic segmentation of aerial images, and more importantly to the realization that to arrive at a high-value image processing algorithm one needs to be comfortable with the underlying mathematical models.

By 2005, I had moved to Canada and had started my Ph.D. on optimization. I found it fascinating that a complex system can be modelled and analyzed mathematically to produce valuable insights. For my Ph.D. thesis, I carried out this type of analysis on a capacity maximization problem in a cellular system and produced a solution strategy. During that period I also worked as a research assistant on video-on-demand network design and maintenance using a multi-layer fuzzy clustering model -- more info in the journal publication.

I joined Epson Canada in 2009, where for six and a half years, I worked on commercial and industrial applications, including visual inspection, symbology detection, 3d object detection and pose estimation, camera calibration, 3d scan/display systems (using stereo, time-of-flight, and structured light projection), head-mounted displays (for augmented and virtual reality), and robotics (assembly and bin-picking). Multiple patents came from that work. I also expanded my work on fuzzy clustering and published several journal papers during this period.

In 2015 I joined Intellijoint Surgical (IJS). This was my first startup experience and a deep dive into cost optimization within the framework of an image processing system. IJS's infrared monocular camera is an exquisite technology that allows for high-accuracy pose estimation in the operating room. I had the opportunity to work on the tracking system and its applications, including an in-vivo infrared laser scanner -— more info in the patents section.

I first participated in the development of a learning-enabled machine vision application in 2016 at Fio. An Andriod-based device ran our ML models to recognize rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and read their results in the field. An RDT is a cassette, 5-10 centimetres (2-4 inches) long, on which one or multiple active membranes allow for rapid testing for diseases such as Malaria, HIV, Dengue, Zeka, etc. Thousands of RDTs in the market each require that a certain ammount of saliva, blood, or urine is added to a certain membrane. Additional chemical solutions are also required to be added to other membranes on the RDT. While RDTs are manufactured in large numbers in order to facilitate massive cost-efficient deployments of disease diagnostics, the task of information collection from such deployments mandates the addition of machines to the network.

When I joined Fio, the company had already field-tested its V-100 version and was working on its V-200 system. These handheld devices allowed for controlled imaging of RDTs in the field. Our algorithm visually recognized the RDT and thus provided healthcare-workers with info on the use of their particular RDT. Our system then assisted and monitored the healthcare-worker as they processed the RDT and the patient. After the incubation time for the RDT was complete, we asked the healthcare-worker to put the RDT back in the device drawer, for a final image that was processed by a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to determine if the patient was positive/negative or whether the test had been soiled due to excessive blood deposition, for example. I led the development of this system in Matlab and we then machine-translated it to python.

As the precision and recall figures from the algo moved into more valuable zones, we also envisioned reducing the human-machine friction and developed designs for an overhead system, composed of cameras and projectors, an active desk for the healthcare-worker in effect. This device tracked the healthcare-worker's hands as they moved RDTs and other objects around and provided assistance through interactive objects that were projected on the desk -— more info in the patents section.

In 2019 Betterview enabled me to experiment with a nuclear network that consumes aerial images and other types of data to produce property insights. By this time I had already spent two years on Coursera, and other online MOOC resources, and I was entirely comfortable with python and its machinery for scientific programming (numpy, scipy, seaborn, pandas, etc.), and more specifically machine/deep learning (tensorflow, scikit-learn). Additionally, hands-on experience allowed me to develop massive gpu-saving strategies and to obtain cloud programming (aws/gcs) and efficient human annotation management (mturk/dls/boutique) skills.

That work has continued to be a source of fascinating results in terms of precision, recall, and iou numbers that the state-of-the-art networks of convolutional neural networks are capable of producing.

In late 2018 I started a self-funded exploratory/educational project that aimed at developing a mobile robot that could recognize its operator and maneuver in its environment. As the robot was subsequently named, Blue is a Sphero RVR connected to an ad-hoc mesh network of Raspberry Pis and other linux machines. Blue perceives its environment through rgb images as well as dsm+imu (through an intel realsense stereo camera). The code for Blue is written in bash and python (including django). Blue uses aws s3/rds for file/data storage and aws sqs for communication.

Blue is a continuous machine learning system that manages the full circle of data acquisition, human annotation collection, model training, and inference through cooperation with the other nodes on the network.
