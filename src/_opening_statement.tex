I am enthusiastic about systems that survive, be it a living organism that evolves and adapts to the changing environment or an algorithm that is robust against noise and the unseen. I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, and I have indeed worked as an Electrical Engineer in the past, yet the best thing that I am capable of doing, and love doing, and have been grappling with in the past 10+ years, is designing systems that distantly resemble human cognition, especially in the fields of Machine Vision and visual perception. That effort has resulted in 10+ patents, 10+ journal papers, a stable and growing career, and, most importantly, the passion and conviction that General Intelligence will be constructed by mankind before I stop breathing. I love books and films and music and I am interested in writing, both for silicon machines as well as flesh ones. I am an amateur digital arts hobbyist and I am fascinated by the Socratic method. Life is too precious for work to be a mere survival mechanism.
